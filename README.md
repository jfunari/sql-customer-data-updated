In this project, I worked with a customer dataset to perform exploratory analysis and prepare data for further use in potential subsequent projects. Uploaded the customer dataset and explored the data using SQL queries to gain initial insights. Executed various SQL queries to analyze key customer metrics, such as demographics, purchase history, and engagement patterns. Saved all SQL queries and CSV files in a GitHub repository to ensure proper version control, collaboration, and documentation throughout the project lifecycle.
